# Digital-Electronics-Verilog

A comprehensive repository showcasing my dedicated efforts in designing  digital electronics circuits using Verilog HDL. The project is systematically organized into combinational and sequential circuits, with each design verified through simulation, and well-documented. This repository serves as a consolidated reference for digital logic design fundamentals, RTL design best practices, and simulation-based verification.
